/// - MIDI effects act upon MIDI signals and can only be placed in MIDI tracks.
/// - Audio effects act upon audio signals and can be placed in audio tracks. 
///     They can also be placed in MIDI tracks as long as they are “downstream“ from an instrument.
/// - Instruments are devices that reside in MIDI tracks, receive MIDI and output audio.
